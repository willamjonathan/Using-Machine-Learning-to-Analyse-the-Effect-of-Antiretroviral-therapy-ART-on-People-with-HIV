<h3><b>Dear reader,</h3>
<br>
<t>My name is William Jonathan Mulyadi, I'm currently an undergraduate student at Bina Nusantara International University. This github repository contains the files tht is used to create my Final Project for Fundamental of Data Science.<br>
<h1>Details of the project:</h1><br>
Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV is a virus that attacks the bodyâ€™s immune system. HIV is a virus that has become a world problem as its cure has not yet been found. The HIV can go to an undetected state if only treated by ART or antiretroviral therapy. Hence, knowing the danger that HIV brings, we are here to analyze the effect of Antiretroviral therapy or ART to HIV using  several of its categories between 75 countries. We are planning to use machine learning techniques that are available. We will use both supervised and unsupervised learning, then we will do evaluation by using accuracy testing, recall, precision, and F1-score. After that, we will conclude which machine learning is the best to applied to our dataset.

<h1> Goal: </h1><br>
To find the best machine learning techniques for predicting the effect of ART to the population with HIV in 75 countries. Besides that, to identify groups of similar objects in datasets with two or more variable quantities by using clustering method.<br>
